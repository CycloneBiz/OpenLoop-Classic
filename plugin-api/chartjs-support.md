# ChartJS Support

### Old way (UNSUPPORTED)

```python
io.publish("My Friends", 10) # Intergers are only supported
io.generate_origin()
io.feature["My very not annoyed friends"] = "My Friends"
-> This will create a Chart with the key "My very not annoyed friends" set to the subbase "My Friends"
```

You also need to enable "feature" in settings `io.settings["`feature`"] = True`

### Using CrossWeb

CrossWeb has not been introduced yet, but it will in 0.2-Maple (0.2-Beta)
