# OpenLoop
Dashboard and designated system for managing IOT devices. Capable of managing Serial, Lora, I2C and other technology with a modified Python system.
## Notice
This is currently not done, theres currently no way to properly deploy code via the CLI and OpenLoop demonstrates many things like ChartJS support so it might take a while until full production release.
